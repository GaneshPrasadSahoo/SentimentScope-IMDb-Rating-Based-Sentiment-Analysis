## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Predicts sentiment polarity (positive/negative) from IMDb reviews.
- **LSTM Model**: Utilizes LSTM networks to capture contextual relationships in text data.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, padding, and embedding for efficient model training.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Insights**: Analyzes the correlation between user sentiments and IMDb ratings.
